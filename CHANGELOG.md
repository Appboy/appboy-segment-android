## 8.0.1

##### Updated
- Updated to [Braze Android SDK 13.1.1](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1311).

## 8.0.0

##### Breaking
- Updated to [Braze Android SDK 13.1.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1310).
- In your top-level project `build.gradle`, add the following as repositories under `allprojects` -> `repositories`:
```
maven { url "http://appboy.github.io/appboy-segment-android/sdk" }
```

##### Added
- Added support for `String[]` typed `Traits` values.

## 7.0.0

##### Breaking
- Updated to [Braze Android SDK 10.0.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1000).

## 6.0.0

##### Breaking
- Updated to [Braze Android SDK 9.0.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#900).

## 5.0.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue where purchases would be logged for any `track` payload with `products` included. After this fix, a `track` payload must either contain `revenue` or have the event name `Order Completed` to result in a logged purchase to Braze.
- Fixes an issue where `anonymousId` and `userId` could be set as custom attributes when calling `identify()`.

## 4.0.0

##### Breaking
- Log separate purchases for each `product` in the `products` array in a `track` call.
  - In the past we always used the event name as the Braze product ID.
  - Now if a track call has the event name `Order Completed` or key `revenue` included in `properties` and has a `products` array, we will log each object in the array as a separate purchase using `productId` as the Braze product ID. `price` and `quantity` will be read from the individual array if available and all non-Braze recognized fields from the high level `properties` and each individual array will be combined and sent as event properties.
  - If there is no `products` array we will continue using the event name as the Braze product ID if the key `revenue` is included in `properties`.

## 3.0.0

##### Breaking
- Updated to [Braze Android SDK 6.0.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#600).

##### Changed
- The `campaign` property value is now casted to `ValueMap` instead of its `Properties` subclass.
  - See https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-segment-android/pull/19. Thanks @ciaranmul!
- The `appboy-sample` sample app is now located within this repo instead of a separate standalone repo.
- The SDK code has been moved into a directory called `appboy-segment-integration`.

## 2.5.2

##### Fixed
- Fixed potential for null pointer exception in the `identify()` method resulting from a null value for `Appboy.getCurrentUser()`.

## 2.5.1

##### Added
- Added support for `double` typed `Traits` values.

## 2.5.0

##### Breaking
- Updated to [Braze Android SDK 3.7.1](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#371).
- Removed the Feedback feature.

## 2.4.1

##### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where the following default attributes would also be logged as custom attributes when set through a call to `identify()`: "birthday", "email", "firstName", "lastName", "gender", "phone", "address".

## 2.4.0

##### Breaking
- Updated to [Braze Android SDK 3.3.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#330).

## 2.3.0

##### Breaking
- Updated to [Braze Android SDK 3.2.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#321).
  - Added `AppboyFirebaseMessagingService` to directly use the Firebase messaging event `com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT`. This is now the recommended way to integrate Firebase push with Braze. The `AppboyFcmReceiver` should be removed from your `AndroidManifest` and replaced with the following:
    ```
    <service android:name="com.appboy.AppboyFirebaseMessagingService">
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
      </intent-filter>
    </service>
    ```
    - Also note that any `c2dm` related permissions should be removed from your manifest as Braze does not require any extra permissions for `AppboyFirebaseMessagingService` to work correctly.
